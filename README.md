## Description

The STK600 repository is a set of library's used in the [module](https://github.com/sunriax/module) and other repositories for communication with different microchips and or semiconductors. It has been written to abstract the software from the hardware platform. Our aim is that platform can be changed (e.g. from RISC to ARM without changing the developed software (like a browser). The STK600 library supports (@ the moment) only the ATmega2560 (STK500 supports ATmega8/16/...) but it will increase in the future.

1. Supported Controller
   * Atmel ATmega2560 (and comparable)
   * ATmega with same interface type as ATmega2560
1. Development Hardware
   * STK600 ([Atmel](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATSTK600))
1. Additional Hardware
   * LCD Module ([Displaytech 162A](https://www.displaytech-us.com/sites/default/files/display-data-sheet/162A%20series-v21.pdf))
1. Development Software
   * Atmel Studio (uC C/C++)

## Abstraction

![Graphical Description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunriax/manual/master/docs/image/STK600_abstraction.png "Graphical Description")

## Getting Started

Every project has a demo application as side car (e.g. uart has uartDEMO). This demo can be used as quick start guide. We also try to keep our [WIKI](https://wiki.sunriax.at) up-to-date. Also there is a short description at the libraries folder:


* [UART](./uart/uart.md)


## Compatibility

In the following table functions which are compatible with the function in the first row are listed.

| Function | uart |
|---------:|:----:|
| uart     |      |


(At the moment not all functions are tested in combination, so if there is any issue please feel free to report!)

## Important Notice

This files are valid for all repositories at the SUNriaX Github!
* [Readme](https://github.com/sunriax/manual/blob/master/README.md)
* [License](https://github.com/sunriax/manual/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

## Additional Information

You can find more additional information in the [manual](https://github.com/sunriax/manual/tree/master/docs) repository and/or visit the [WIKI](https://wiki.sunriax.at/) for further information (currently under construction).

If there are any further questions feel free to start an issue or contact us, we try to react as quick as possible.
